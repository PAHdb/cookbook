API Overview
##############

Before moving to the recipes themselves, an overview of the
Application Programming Interface (API) used by the (offline) software
tools is presented. PAHdb's (offline) software tools follow largely
the same API for both the IDL and Python implementations. The API is
designed around an object-oriented paradigm where each class handles a
distinct aspect of the spectroscopic data and/or models. Each of these
aspects is discussed in turn.
