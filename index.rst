NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database
---------------------------------------

The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database [#f1]_ [#f2]_ (PAHdb hereafter)
hosts the world's foremost collection of infrared (IR) PAH spectra. PAHdb's
spectral libraries contain over 3,000 laboratory measured and quantum chemically
computed PAH spectra. Beyond spectroscopic data, PAHdb also provides software
tools to work with the spectral data. The portal to the data and tools is the
PAHdb website, which is located at `https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb
<https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb>`_. This is the PAHdb cookbook that
provides an overview of the Application Programming Interface used for the
software tools and a collection of recipes for data analysis.

Please consult the `Document Portal <https:/PAHdb.github.io>`_ and
PAHdb `website <https://astrochemistry.org/pahdb>`_ for additional
resources and information.

.. [#f1] Since FY2019 the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database is being
         supported through a directed Work Package at NASA Ames titled:
         "Laboratory Astrophysics â€“- The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic
         Database".

.. [#f2] Since FY2023 the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database is being
         supported through the Laboratory Astrophysics Round 2 directed Work
         Package at NASA Ames.
