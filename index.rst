NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database
---------------------------------------

The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database [#f1]_ [#f2]_ [#f3]_ (PAHdb
hereafter) hosts the world's foremost collection of infrared (IR) PAH spectra.
PAHdb's spectral libraries contain over 3,000 laboratory measured and quantum
chemically computed PAH spectra. Beyond spectroscopic data, PAHdb also provides
software tools to work with the spectral data. The portal to the data and tools
is the PAHdb website, which is located at `https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb
<https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb>`_. This is the PAHdb cookbook that
provides an overview of the Application Programming Interface used for the
software tools and a collection of recipes for data analysis.

Please consult the `Document Portal <https:/PAHdb.github.io>`_ and
PAHdb `website <https://astrochemistry.org/pahdb>`_ for additional
resources and information.
